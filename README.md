# Genshin recipe Tracker Client

This is the front-end of Genshin recipe-Tracker

This light program allows the user to store their character recipes from the game Genshin Impact.

The goal is to allow the user to have an index of character/recipes they own in the game and in later version allow the user to attach weapon and artifacts(equipments) to each character.
